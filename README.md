DLIME: Deterministic Local Explanations on Iris Dataset
Student Name: Tarang Gupta

Objective: To improve the reliability of XAI (Explainable AI) by implementing a deterministic clustering approach.

Key Features
Accuracy: Achieved 100.00% using a Random Forest "Black Box" model.

Stability: Proven 100% stable results (Weights remained constant at 0.896118 across 5 iterations).

Algorithms: Agglomerative Clustering for deterministic grouping and KNN for local mapping.

How to Run
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
